Refugees Claim\\n25 July 2016, 15:09 | Updated: 1 September 2016, 15:29\\nNick Ferrari took the director of Amnesty International to task after he claimed that Europe was not disproportionately affected by refugees.\\nA 27-year-old Syrian man was the suspected suicide bomber in Ansbach, Germany, who injured 12 people outside a wine bar last night. And a Syrian refugee was arrested after a woman was stabbed to death with a machete in southern Germany.\\nNick was asking: Is this the new normal in Europe now?\\nSteve Symonds, the UK's Refugee Programme Director for Amnesty International, told Nick that refugees are not a disproportionate problem in Europe.\\nAnd that led to a fiery row with Nick. Watch their clash above.\\nThe disagreement started when Mr Symonds said: \"Europe is not disproportionately affect by number. You look at countries like Jordan and Lebanon, who are hosting much higher numbers.\"\\nNick interjected: \"It might not be disproportionate in numbers, but it's certainly disproportionately affected by terrorism.\"\\nWhen Mr Symonds denied that, Nick insisted: \"Hang on, until the arrival of these folk, Europe was a relatively calm continent.\\n\"Now, either the sons of or people who come from other countries think it's a great idea to shoot people who are having a hamburger or blow themselves up at music festivals.\\n\"You don't think that's changed the shape of Europe at all?\"\\nThe Amnesty Director claimed that it's not just a European problem, but Nick added: \"I just care about Europe. If they want to go and blow themselves up in Jordan and Syria, let them go and blow themselves up all day long.\\n\"Coming here to blow up kids in Paris, Nice, Germany and London is wrong.\\n\"I certainly can't control the Middle East. I can at least try and control Europe.\"\\nThe Best Of Nick Ferrari\\nThe Car-Crash Interview Everyone's Talking About: Diane Abbott On Police Funding\\nNick Ferrari's Intensely Personal Reason Why

6:00pm (EST) - Sunday, July 20 at 6:00pm (EST).\\nJune 10, 2014. For Immediate Release--THE HUNT FOR TOMORROW is an on-line scavenger hunt that will send participants on a virtual odyssey through twenty-two dystopian futures in search of the answers they need to win. The Hunt is on for one weekend only, although there is no time-limit for completing the course.\\nIntrepid scavengers must solve clues at each of the dystopian author stops as they progress through the course. The twenty-two participating indie authors all have books included in three dystopian boxed sets - What Tomorrow May Bring, A Taste of Tomorrow, and Shattered Worlds.\\n\"Indie publishing is often a solitary experience. All of these authors coming together to work toward a common goal is an extraordinary thing,\" said author Tony Bertauski, curator of What Tomorrow May Bring. \"The enthusiasm for an engaging, communal effort like this scavenger hunt shows the willingness of indie authors to share their fans, and that can only be a good thing for readers.\"\\nWINNER TO NAME CHARACTERS AND TITLE FOR INTRIGUING PROGRESSIVE STORY\\nIn a rare instance of collaborative story-telling, nineteen of the authors will write a progressive short story over nineteen days. Each author will have one day to write between 500-1000 words before passing the story on to the next author to create a collective vision of a new, dark future. The winner of The Hunt will name characters and contribute elements to create this dystopian world, and all participants in The Hunt will receive an advance copy of the story for an exclusive period before it is made available as a free download.\\nThose who complete the scavenger hunt will be entered into a random draw, and for each correct answer collected along the way they will receive an additional chance to win. Along with the naming opportunity, the Grand Prize also includes a signed copy of each author's book that is included in the boxed sets, an ebook of all the boxed sets, and the first copy of the progressive story they themselves inspired. During The Hunt, the authors will offer up their own exclusive material, sneak peeks, contests, and giveaways at their individual stops on The Hunt, giving all scavengers multiple chances to win bonus prizes.\\nThe indie authors participating in The Hunt include best-selling, award-winning and emerging writers from the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. While their dystopian tales might be bleak, cynical, or despairing visions of the future, they ultimately carry messages of hope.\\nTHE HUNT FOR TOMORROW is the outcome of three separate group endeavors by these independent authors. By jointly marketing their books in curated boxed sets, they are able to successfully cross-promote their work and spike sales in a challenging and competitive marketplace. With the boxed sets, the scavenger hunt, and the progressively written short story, these dystopian authors are staking out their own collaborative utopia in the brave new world of indie publishing.\\nTHE HUNT FOR TOMORROW begins at http://huntfortomorrow.blogspot.com on Friday, July 18 at 6:00pm (EST) and ends on Sunday, July 20 at 6:00pm (EST). The Hunt is open to scavengers around the world; there is no cost to enter and one grand prize winner will be selected at random from all eligible entries.\\nThe DYSTOPTIMISTS\\nShining Light on a Dark Future\\nWHAT TOMORROW MAY BRING boxed set\\nSusan Kaye Quinn *\\nDavid J Normoyle\\nJoeseph Turkot\\nA TASTE OF TOMORROW boxed set\\nJason Gurley*\\nChris Ward\\nSaul Tanpepper\\nDeirdre Gould\\nSHATTERED WORLDS boxed set\\nElle Casey**\\nKatie French\\nZoe Cannon*\\nScott Cramer\\nShalini Boland\\nSarah Dalton\\n*Hunt only, not contributing to progressive short story\\n**Short story only, not participating in Hunt.\\nhttp://huntfortomorrow.blogspot.com\\nPlease include this information in any upcoming announcements and event listings.\\nFor further information, interview requests, ebooks for review, and book cover or author images please contact:\\nrixwrites@bell.net\\nBe Ready for The Hunt\\nPosted by Tony Bertauski at 12:35 PM\n","10639  ← From a \"wide portfolio\" to systemic support for foundational learning: The evolution of the Central Square Foundation's work on education in India (Part 2)\\nThe Whole Child Model at the Van Ness Elementary School: A Conversation with Keptah Saint Julien (Part 1) →\\nPraxis, teacher education and symmetry: The Lead the Change interview with Sarah Fine\\nPosted on April 20, 2022 by T Hatch | Leave a comment\\nThis month's Lead the Change (LtC) interview features a conversation with Dr. Sarah Fine, an educator and scholar working at the intersection of practice and research. Fine currently directs the San Diego Teacher Residency, hosted at the High Tech High Graduate School of Education, and also teaches courses in educational leadership at the University of California San Diego and at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. Her recent book, coauthored with Jal Mehta, is In Search of Deeper learning: The Quest to Transform the American High School.\\nLead The Change: The 2022 AERA theme is Cultivating Equitable Education Systems for the 21st Century and charges researchers and practitioners with dismantling oppressive education systems and replacing them with antiracist, equity, and justice-oriented systems. To achieve these goals, researchers must engage in new methodologies, cross-disciplinary thinking, global perspectives, and community partnerships to respond to the challenges of the 21st century including the COVID-19 Pandemic and systemic racism among other persistent inequities. Given the dire need for all of us to do more to dismantle oppressive systems and reimagine new ways of thinking and doing in our own institutions and education more broadly, what specific responsibility do educational change scholars have in this space? What steps are you taking to heed this call?\\nSarah Fine: Paulo Freire offered us the notion of praxis: cycles of inquiry which involve thinking critically about how sociopolitical systems work, taking action to create positive change, and reflecting on the process (Freire, 1970). A number of brilliant folks have written about how educators can take up Freire's ideas in K-12 classrooms (Duncan-Andrade & Morrell, 2008; hooks, 1994). To this work I would add my own conviction that scholars of educational change, too, need to engage in praxis — and I believe that this praxis must involve more than simply galvanizing our students to do good work once they are \"in the field.\" This enlarged vision is no small commitment. The academy tends to reward thought over action, description over transformation, and theorizing about rather than theorizing with those who lead and work in schools. Plus, postulating on paper or in a lecture hall is comfortable; the world of K-12 public schools — \"the field\" — is a muddy, messy, imperfect place where elegant theories are inevitably complicated by the human-ness of human systems. Talking about implications for action is vanishingly simple by comparison to the actual work of making change in schools. I would argue, however, that it is imperative for us to do both: to read and write and observe and theorize, and also to enter into long-term action-focused partnerships which become a \"text\" that informs our scholarship. One without the other is insufficient.\\nThis desire to engage in praxis has been a guide for my own career choice. After nearly a decade spent exploring the notion of deeper learning through qualitative research, I chose to depart academia in order to road-test my ideas by designing and directing a teacher residency program run out of an alternative institution of higher education. I admit that this project sometimes runs the risk of straying from Freire's vision; my days \"in the field\" are sometimes so breathless that they leave little room for reflection. But that, too, tells a story about what it will take to accelerate efforts at transformation. We must reimagine what it means to be in practice as an educator, providing support and incentives for those who spend their time in and around K-12 schools to contribute their wisdom and experiences to the field's knowledge-base. It is these kinds of shifts that can help us all to move beyond patterns of siloing and exploitation and to make good on a collaborative commitment to positive change.\\nLtC: Through your work as the Director of the San Diego Teacher Residency at High Tech High Graduate School of Education, you support future teachers in creating justice-oriented classrooms rooted in deeper learning and strengthen the pipeline for teachers of color. What are some of the major lessons the field of Educational Change can learn from your work and experience?\\nSF: In our recent book, Jal Mehta and I explored the idea of symmetry, e.g. the presence of guiding principles and practices which anchor the experiences of both adults and children in schools (Mehta & Fine, 2019). We argued that schools can make headway toward ambitious goals by cultivating symmetry — for example, by seeking to embed opportunities for extended inquiry or apprenticeship into adult learning as well as into classrooms. Based on my experiences designing and running the San Diego Teacher Residency, it turns out that symmetry is equally important in the context of teacher preparation. This is to say that novice teachers need the same things younger learners do in order to thrive and learn deeply: psychological safety, authentic purposes, culturally affirming pedagogy, tasks which lie within their zone of proximal development, modeling and support from expert mentors, opportunities to engage in productive struggle, and pauses to reflect on and celebrate their growth. On top of this, learning to teach for justice requires unlearning many of the normative beliefs and practices that dominate the field. This is true for white teachers and also for teachers of color, who may more easily recognize the myriad forms of oppression and marginalization that dominate traditional classrooms but still need to experience and learn new repertoires of practice by which to resist the pull of doing things as they have always been done. For example, we have found that with carefully designed coursework and expert facilitation, our teacher residents (white and BIPOC alike) are fairly quick to grasp why punitive and exclusionary classroom disciplinary policies are so inequitable. However, understanding what not to do does not automatically come along with the knowledge of what to do instead — and without viable alternatives, even teachers who recognize harmful practice will revert to the status quo. Thus, helping novices learn to \"see\" the problems of shallow, teacher-centered, eurocentric, one-size-fits- all pedagogy is the tip of the iceberg; the most important work lies in exploring and rehearsing new forms of instructional design and facilitation. This is where deliberate symmetry comes in, because every moment that our residents spend in our care is a moment to \"walk our talk\" by providing them with learning experiences that assist in the process of disruption and replacement.\\n\"Learning to teach for justice requires unlearning many of the normative beliefs and practices that dominate the field.\"\\nLtC: In your recent book, In Search of Deeper Learning, you argue for American high schools to create opportunities for deeper learning, teachers, administrators, parents, and educational communities need to unlearn ideas about schooling and set up organizational structures that value authentic problem solving and depth over breadth (among many other things!). In the past two years, how has remote learning and other school disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic changed this important work?\\nSF: During the long months of zoom school last year, those of us who spend our time thinking about teaching and learning looked on with mixture of apprehension and curiosity. Might the pandemic, for all of its awful-ness, finally open the door for the kinds of educational transformations that children so desperately need? Could this be the thing that would finally loosen the chokehold of the \"grammar of schooling\" that has persisted for more than a century? I wish I could say that the answer was yes — but in reality, the adjustments that I have seen schools and teachers make are subtle rather than dramatic. On the pessimistic side, at least from what I observed, much of what happened during remote schooling last year amounted to a doubling down on traditional practice. Elementary school teachers reverted to non-interactive read-alouds and assigned more than normal amounts of independent work; secondary teachers talked at their students even more than before; and everyone struggled to figure out how to get kids to interact meaningfully in breakout rooms. Things have gradually settled down with the return to in-person schooling this year, but I haven't seen many examples of experiments or transformations. On a more positive note, however, remote schooling seemed to galvanize many teachers and leaders to make serious commitments to relationship-building, social- emotional learning, and trauma-informed practices. These things have always been essential, but until the pandemic forced the issue, they often took a backseat to academic content. I have been heartened to see this shift in priorities persist during this year, but I fear that all the talk of \"learning loss\" — not to mention the surge in staff shortages which are stretching all school staff extremely thin — could quickly return us to where we started. Still, I see the whole situation as being in-process. Perhaps there will continue to be opportunities for educators, parents, and policymakers to realize that the status quo isn't something worth returning to after all. I'd like to believe that the pandemic has at very least increased everyone's appetite for radical change, which could open the door for visionary educators (and scholars?) to try to do things differently.\\n\"Productive change processes require disrupting traditional power dynamics.\"\\nLtC: Educational Change expects those engaged in and with schools, schooling, and school systems to spearhead deep and often difficult transformation. How might those in the field of Educational Change best support these individuals and groups through these processes?\\nSF: As a start, I would argue that those who are spearheading educational change should start by focusing on assets rather than deficits. Ask: Where are the bright spots? Who in our system is already galvanized around doing things differently? If students or educators are not succeeding in certain ways or in certain spaces, where and under what conditions are they thriving? How can we develop what already exists into visible proof-points that help everyone imagine why and how to do things differently? Don't get me wrong — it's still crucial to explore and map out the root causes of dysfunction — but asset-focused questions are far more energizing and efficacious than their inverse. On a separate note, I would argue that productive change processes require disrupting traditional power dynamics. Get folks from all parts of the system at the table together — not just district and school leaders, for example, but teachers and special educators and paraprofessionals and even students — and construct agreements and group culture that encourages them to listen deeply and speak from what they know. This decision honors the idea that the ones closest to the problem are closest to the solution, and it also positions the change process itself, not just the desired goals of the process, as an equity-focused intervention. Finally, I believe that it is critical that everyone involved in the change process needs to see themselves and be seen as a learner. School and district leaders often feel pressure to know \"the answers\" and to direct change from arm's length, but the most powerful processes require new ways of being and doing. In turn, this demands opportunities for everyone involved to engage in productive struggle, to try out new practices without the certainty that they will work, and to experience the kinds of learning and/or culture that is sought for the entire system.\\nLtC: Where do you perceive the field of Educational Change is going? What excites you about Educational Change now and in the future?\\nSF: I began my career as a teacher and (a bit later) my training as a scholar during the first decade of the 21st century: an era which was dominated by an obsession with top-down reforms and narrowly conceived indicators of educational quality. During those years, studying educational change in ways that the academy would validate involved doing research about or on schools and measuring impact using test-score-based metrics. The past decade, however, has seen the start of a long-overdue reckoning with the ways in which education research has too often been voyeuristic, exploitative, racially biased, and limited in its imagination of the possible. The growing visibility of paradigms such as Participatory Action Research and Design Based Implementation Research, along with the amplification of the voices of BIPOC scholars and practitioners and the expansion of Research-Practitioner Partnership opportunities, suggests that the world is gradually recognizing that educational change must involve working with and within communities of practice and defining educational \"goods\" more broadly. This excites me! As I wrote earlier, I believe that scholars of educational change have an obligation to engage in praxis, which requires forming long-term partnerships with practitioners and learning about the world by trying to change it. I'd like to believe that the structures of higher education eventually will shift to support this expansion of scholarly purposes and positioning. As it currently stands at many major schools of education, however, tenure-seeking scholars are still obligated to focus most of their efforts on producing first-authored publications in academic journals — which are stylistically inaccessible to lay readers and also usually live behind paywalls. Teaching and service to the institution come next, with community engagement and public scholarship treated as side-notes. On the other side of the \"research/practice divide,\" the work of educators and school/district leaders is mainly action-focused; there is rarely time or material support for doing much more than keeping the train on the tracks. I hope that the field as a whole will continue to elevate research-practice partnerships which can create positive change for educators and children and produce usable knowledge in the process.\\nDuncan-Andrade, J.

2020\\n4 Comments on The Monckton, Portsmouth: a pub built under fire\\nSomething unusual happened in 1942: a new pub came into being. That's right – not an inter-war pub, or post-war, but one built right in the thick of it.\\nWhen we wrote 20th Century Pub back in 2015-17, we included a chapter on the wartime pub because it felt important. Other chapters were about new developments and new types of pub coming into being; this was about recording a void, or pause.\\nPubs weren't built or opened during World War II, they were destroyed. Even if there had been a will to build, there was a shortage of manpower and building materials.\\nOf course there were odd exceptions: pubs whose construction was underway before the war, completed just over the line; and temporary pubs in shacks, sheds and stables which appeared later on.\\nBut the Monckton in Portsmouth is, we think, the first example we've come across of a somewhat substantial, somewhat solid pub actually being built during World War II.\\nWe say 'somewhat' because, well, look at it. A single storey, raw brick, no embellishments and windows like those of a pillbox. If you told us it was converted from an air-raid shelter, we wouldn't doubt it.\\nHere's what Philip Eley and R.C. Riley have to say in their excellent 1991 monograph on the Portsmouth pubs between 1900 and 1950:\\n[It employed] a beerhouse licence transferred from the Dockyard Tavern, Marlborough Row (which had been enveloped by the Dockyard extension)… The site had been bought by United Breweries in 1911, and remarkably, in the light of the ersatz nature of the ultimate construction, the first application for a licence in 1928 was backed by a design from [important local architect A.E.] Cogswell himself. Four subsequent unsuccessful applications between 1929 and 1939 can hardly have presaged what was arguably Portsmouth's most distinctive drinking house until its closure in 1982.\\nThe picture above, sourced from the same booklet, was taken in 1946 so this was clearly the pub in its finished state, not under construction as suggested here.\\nThat page at closedpubs.co.uk includes another picture of the pub, though, prettied up in the post-war period, with rendering, whitewash and some cute external adornments.\\nCopnor Road in 1972 with The Monckton in the background, via The News, Portsmouth.\\nLike many make-do-and-mend pubs of the 1940s and early 1950s, The Monckton survived longer than might have been expected, still trading into the 1980s.\\nWhat isn't immediately obvious is why construction of this pub was authorised during a time of restrictions.\\n\"Bet this was controversial,\" we said to ourselves and it didn't take long to find evidence that, yes, it was, in the form of a letter to the Portsmouth Evening News published on 13 February 1942:\\nSir – On Sunday night I listened to Sir Stafford Cripps giving his very interesting and informative talk on Russia's mighty effort to win the war. During this talk every listener was more or less asked, by Sir Stafford, to search his or her conscience as to whether they were engaged on or doing 100 per cent, work and thought, to bring about the same conclusion… I always feel that it is not fair to judge a nation's effort by one own city or locality. There would, however, appear to something wrong in Portsmouth when I notice this afternoon a new public-house being built on Copnor Road. Surely the men engaged in this contract, and the materials being used, could be put to our war effort, at this critical time? I know the answer will be \"a licence was granted,\" but what right had that particular public servant to grant such a licence? He was given his present position to control the building industry and direct its use to the war effort, not to evade the Government Order (Restricting New Buildings) by issuing permits. It appears to that we want quite a number of men in key positions who can say and definitely mean it.\\nOur guess, pending further research, is that it was a question of morale.\\nPortsmouth lost 73 pubs to enemy action during 1940-41 and Eley and Riley reckon more than a hundred had been destroyed by February 1942.\\nPerhaps sparing a few bricks for the construction of a basic two-room pub felt worth it.\\nTags hampshire, portsmouth, war, world war ii"],"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-ea94e24d-3833-4c29-9d1e-bd82ad7d46c0\" class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>text</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>31946</th>\n","      <td>Nick Takes Amnesty To Task Over Refugees Claim\\n25 July 2016, 15:09 | Updated: 1 September 2016, 15:29\\nNick Ferrari took the director of Amnesty International to task after he claimed that Europe was not disproportionately affected by refugees.\\nA 27-year-old Syrian man was the suspected suicide bomber in Ansbach, Germany, who injured 12 people outside a wine bar last night.

For Immediate Release--THE HUNT FOR TOMORROW is an on-line scavenger hunt that will send participants on a virtual odyssey through twenty-two dystopian futures in search of the answers they need to win. The Hunt is on for one weekend only, although there is no time-limit for completing the course.\\nIntrepid scavengers must solve clues at each of the dystopian author stops as they progress through the course. The twenty-two participating indie authors all have books included in three dystopian boxed sets - What Tomorrow May Bring, A Taste of Tomorrow, and Shattered Worlds.\\n\"Indie publishing is often a solitary experience. All of these authors coming together to work toward a common goal is an extraordinary thing,\" said author Tony Bertauski, curator of What Tomorrow May Bring. \"The enthusiasm for an engaging, communal effort like this scavenger hunt shows the willingness of indie authors to share their fans, and that can only be a good thing for readers.\"\\nWINNER TO NAME CHARACTERS AND TITLE FOR INTRIGUING PROGRESSIVE STORY\\nIn a rare instance of collaborative story-telling, nineteen of the authors will write a progressive short story over nineteen days. Each author will have one day to write between 500-1000 words before passing the story on to the next author to create a collective vision of a new, dark future. The winner of The Hunt will name characters and contribute elements to create this dystopian world, and all participants in The Hunt will receive an advance copy of the story for an exclusive period before it is made available as a free download.\\nThose who complete the scavenger hunt will be entered into a random draw, and for each correct answer collected along the way they will receive an additional chance to win. Along with the naming opportunity, the Grand Prize also includes a signed copy of each author's book that is included in the boxed sets, an ebook of all the boxed sets, and the first copy of the progressive story they themselves inspired. During The Hunt, the authors will offer up their own exclusive material, sneak peeks, contests, and giveaways at their individual stops on The Hunt, giving all scavengers multiple chances to win bonus prizes.\\nThe indie authors participating in The Hunt include best-selling, award-winning and emerging writers from the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. While their dystopian tales might be bleak, cynical, or despairing visions of the future, they ultimately carry messages of hope.\\nTHE HUNT FOR TOMORROW is the outcome of three separate group endeavors by these independent authors. By jointly marketing their books in curated boxed sets, they are able to successfully cross-promote their work and spike sales in a challenging and competitive marketplace. With the boxed sets, the scavenger hunt, and the progressively written short story, these dystopian authors are staking out their own collaborative utopia in the brave new world of indie publishing.\\nTHE HUNT FOR TOMORROW begins at http://huntfortomorrow.blogspot.com on Friday, July 18 at 6:00pm (EST) and ends on Sunday, July 20 at 6:00pm (EST).

Fine currently directs the San Diego Teacher Residency, hosted at the High Tech High Graduate School of Education, and also teaches courses in educational leadership at the University of California San Diego and at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. Her recent book, coauthored with Jal Mehta, is In Search of Deeper learning: The Quest to Transform the American High School.\\nLead The Change: The 2022 AERA theme is Cultivating Equitable Education Systems for the 21st Century and charges researchers and practitioners with dismantling oppressive education systems and replacing them with antiracist, equity, and justice-oriented systems. To achieve these goals, researchers must engage in new methodologies, cross-disciplinary thinking, global perspectives, and community partnerships to respond to the challenges of the 21st century including the COVID-19 Pandemic and systemic racism among other persistent inequities. Given the dire need for all of us to do more to dismantle oppressive systems and reimagine new ways of thinking and doing in our own institutions and education more broadly, what specific responsibility do educational change scholars have in this space? What steps are you taking to heed this call?\\nSarah Fine: Paulo Freire offered us the notion of praxis: cycles of inquiry which involve thinking critically about how sociopolitical systems work, taking action to create positive change, and reflecting on the process (Freire, 1970). A number of brilliant folks have written about how educators can take up Freire's ideas in K-12 classrooms (Duncan-Andrade &amp; Morrell, 2008; hooks, 1994). To this work I would add my own conviction that scholars of educational change, too, need to engage in praxis — and I believe that this praxis must involve more than simply galvanizing our students to do good work once they are \"in the field.\" This enlarged vision is no small commitment. The academy tends to reward thought over action, description over transformation, and theorizing about rather than theorizing with those who lead and work in schools. Plus, postulating on paper or in a lecture hall is comfortable; the world of K-12 public schools — \"the field\" — is a muddy, messy, imperfect place where elegant theories are inevitably complicated by the human-ness of human systems. Talking about implications for action is vanishingly simple by comparison to the actual work of making change in schools. I would argue, however, that it is imperative for us to do both: to read and write and observe and theorize, and also to enter into long-term action-focused partnerships which become a \"text\" that informs our scholarship. One without the other is insufficient.\\nThis desire to engage in praxis has been a guide for my own career choice. After nearly a decade spent exploring the notion of deeper learning through qualitative research, I chose to depart academia in order to road-test my ideas by designing and directing a teacher residency program run out of an alternative institution of higher education. I admit that this project sometimes runs the risk of straying from Freire's vision; my days \"in the field\" are sometimes so breathless that they leave little room for reflection. But that, too, tells a story about what it will take to accelerate efforts at transformation. We must reimagine what it means to be in practice as an educator, providing support and incentives for those who spend their time in and around K-12 schools to contribute their wisdom and experiences to the field's knowledge-base. It is these kinds of shifts that can help us all to move beyond patterns of siloing and exploitation and to make good on a collaborative commitment to positive change.\\nLtC: Through your work as the Director of the San Diego Teacher Residency at High Tech High Graduate School of Education, you support future teachers in creating justice-oriented classrooms rooted in deeper learning and strengthen the pipeline for teachers of color. What are some of the major lessons the field of Educational Change can learn from your work and experience?\\nSF: In our recent book, Jal Mehta and I explored the idea of symmetry, e.g. the presence of guiding principles and practices which anchor the experiences of both adults and children in schools (Mehta &amp; Fine, 2019). We argued that schools can make headway toward ambitious goals by cultivating symmetry — for example, by seeking to embed opportunities for extended inquiry or apprenticeship into adult learning as well as into classrooms. Based on my experiences designing and running the San Diego Teacher Residency, it turns out that symmetry is equally important in the context of teacher preparation. This is to say that novice teachers need the same things younger learners do in order to thrive and learn deeply: psychological safety, authentic purposes, culturally affirming pedagogy, tasks which lie within their zone of proximal development, modeling and support from expert mentors, opportunities to engage in productive struggle, and pauses to reflect on and celebrate their growth. On top of this, learning to teach for justice requires unlearning many of the normative beliefs and practices that dominate the field. This is true for white teachers and also for teachers of color, who may more easily recognize the myriad forms of oppression and marginalization that dominate traditional classrooms but still need to experience and learn new repertoires of practice by which to resist the pull of doing things as they have always been done. For example, we have found that with carefully designed coursework and expert facilitation, our teacher residents (white and BIPOC alike) are fairly quick to grasp why punitive and exclusionary classroom disciplinary policies are so inequitable. However, understanding what not to do does not automatically come along with the knowledge of what to do instead — and without viable alternatives, even teachers who recognize harmful practice will revert to the status quo. Thus, helping novices learn to \"see\" the problems of shallow, teacher-centered, eurocentric, one-size-fits- all pedagogy is the tip of the iceberg; the most important work lies in exploring and rehearsing new forms of instructional design and facilitation. This is where deliberate symmetry comes in, because every moment that our residents spend in our care is a moment to \"walk our talk\" by providing them with learning experiences that assist in the process of disruption and replacement.\\n\"Learning to teach for justice requires unlearning many of the normative beliefs and practices that dominate the field.\"\\nLtC: In your recent book, In Search of Deeper Learning, you argue for American high schools to create opportunities for deeper learning, teachers, administrators, parents, and educational communities need to unlearn ideas about schooling and set up organizational structures that value authentic problem solving and depth over breadth (among many other things!). In the past two years, how has remote learning and other school disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic changed this important work?\\nSF: During the long months of zoom school last year, those of us who spend our time thinking about teaching and learning looked on with mixture of apprehension and curiosity. Might the pandemic, for all of its awful-ness, finally open the door for the kinds of educational transformations that children so desperately need? Could this be the thing that would finally loosen the chokehold of the \"grammar of schooling\" that has persisted for more than a century? I wish I could say that the answer was yes — but in reality, the adjustments that I have seen schools and teachers make are subtle rather than dramatic. On the pessimistic side, at least from what I observed, much of what happened during remote schooling last year amounted to a doubling down on traditional practice. Elementary school teachers reverted to non-interactive read-alouds and assigned more than normal amounts of independent work; secondary teachers talked at their students even more than before; and everyone struggled to figure out how to get kids to interact meaningfully in breakout rooms. Things have gradually settled down with the return to in-person schooling this year, but I haven't seen many examples of experiments or transformations. On a more positive note, however, remote schooling seemed to galvanize many teachers and leaders to make serious commitments to relationship-building, social- emotional learning, and trauma-informed practices. These things have always been essential, but until the pandemic forced the issue, they often took a backseat to academic content. I have been heartened to see this shift in priorities persist during this year, but I fear that all the talk of \"learning loss\" — not to mention the surge in staff shortages which are stretching all school staff extremely thin — could quickly return us to where we started. Still, I see the whole situation as being in-process. Perhaps there will continue to be opportunities for educators, parents, and policymakers to realize that the status quo isn't something worth returning to after all. I'd like to believe that the pandemic has at very least increased everyone's appetite for radical change, which could open the door for visionary educators (and scholars?) to try to do things differently.\\n\"Productive change processes require disrupting traditional power dynamics.\"\\nLtC: Educational Change expects those engaged in and with schools, schooling, and school systems to spearhead deep and often difficult transformation. How might those in the field of Educational Change best support these individuals and groups through these processes?\\nSF: As a start, I would argue that those who are spearheading educational change should start by focusing on assets rather than deficits. Ask: Where are the bright spots? Who in our system is already galvanized around doing things differently? If students or educators are not succeeding in certain ways or in certain spaces, where and under what conditions are they thriving? How can we develop what already exists into visible proof-points that help everyone imagine why and how to do things differently? Don't get me wrong — it's still crucial to explore and map out the root causes of dysfunction — but asset-focused questions are far more energizing and efficacious than their inverse. On a separate note, I would argue that productive change processes require disrupting traditional power dynamics. Get folks from all parts of the system at the table together — not just district and school leaders, for example, but teachers and special educators and paraprofessionals and even students — and construct agreements and group culture that encourages them to listen deeply and speak from what they know. This decision honors the idea that the ones closest to the problem are closest to the solution, and it also positions the change process itself, not just the desired goals of the process, as an equity-focused intervention. Finally, I believe that it is critical that everyone involved in the change process needs to see themselves and be seen as a learner. School and district leaders often feel pressure to know \"the answers\" and to direct change from arm's length, but the most powerful processes require new ways of being and doing. In turn, this demands opportunities for everyone involved to engage in productive struggle, to try out new practices without the certainty that they will work, and to experience the kinds of learning and/or culture that is sought for the entire system.\\nLtC: Where do you perceive the field of Educational Change is going? What excites you about Educational Change now and in the future?\\nSF: I began my career as a teacher and (a bit later) my training as a scholar during the first decade of the 21st century: an era which was dominated by an obsession with top-down reforms and narrowly conceived indicators of educational quality. During those years, studying educational change in ways that the academy would validate involved doing research about or on schools and measuring impact using test-score-based metrics. The past decade, however, has seen the start of a long-overdue reckoning with the ways in which education research has too often been voyeuristic, exploitative, racially biased, and limited in its imagination of the possible. The growing visibility of paradigms such as Participatory Action Research and Design Based Implementation Research, along with the amplification of the voices of BIPOC scholars and practitioners and the expansion of Research-Practitioner Partnership opportunities, suggests that the world is gradually recognizing that educational change must involve working with and within communities of practice and defining educational \"goods\" more broadly. This excites me! As I wrote earlier, I believe that scholars of educational change have an obligation to engage in praxis, which requires forming long-term partnerships with practitioners and learning about the world by trying to change it. I'd like to believe that the structures of higher education eventually will shift to support this expansion of scholarly purposes and positioning. As it currently stands at many major schools of education, however, tenure-seeking scholars are still obligated to focus most of their efforts on producing first-authored publications in academic journals — which are stylistically inaccessible to lay readers and also usually live behind paywalls. Teaching and service to the institution come next, with community engagement and public scholarship treated as side-notes. On the other side of the \"research/practice divide,\" the work of educators and school/district leaders is mainly action-focused; there is rarely time or material support for doing much more than keeping the train on the tracks. I hope that the field as a whole will continue to elevate research-practice partnerships which can create positive change for educators and children and produce usable knowledge in the process.\\nDuncan-Andrade, J.

That's right – not an inter-war pub, or post-war, but one built right in the thick of it.\\nWhen we wrote 20th Century Pub back in 2015-17, we included a chapter on the wartime pub because it felt important. Other chapters were about new developments and new types of pub coming into being; this was about recording a void, or pause.\\nPubs weren't built or opened during World War II, they were destroyed. Even if there had been a will to build, there was a shortage of manpower and building materials.\\nOf course there were odd exceptions: pubs whose construction was underway before the war, completed just over the line; and temporary pubs in shacks, sheds and stables which appeared later on.\\nBut the Monckton in Portsmouth is, we think, the first example we've come across of a somewhat substantial, somewhat solid pub actually being built during World War II.\\nWe say 'somewhat' because, well, look at it. A single storey, raw brick, no embellishments and windows like those of a pillbox. If you told us it was converted from an air-raid shelter, we wouldn't doubt it.\\nHere's what Philip Eley and R.C. Riley have to say in their excellent 1991 monograph on the Portsmouth pubs between 1900 and 1950:\\n[It employed] a beerhouse licence transferred from the Dockyard Tavern, Marlborough Row (which had been enveloped by the Dockyard extension)… The site had been bought by United Breweries in 1911, and remarkably, in the light of the ersatz nature of the ultimate construction, the first application for a licence in 1928 was backed by a design from [important local architect A.E.] Cogswell himself. Four subsequent unsuccessful applications between 1929 and 1939 can hardly have presaged what was arguably Portsmouth's most distinctive drinking house until its closure in 1982.\\nThe picture above, sourced from the same booklet, was taken in 1946 so this was clearly the pub in its finished state, not under construction as suggested here.\\nThat page at closedpubs.co.uk includes another picture of the pub, though, prettied up in the post-war period, with rendering, whitewash and some cute external adornments.\\nCopnor Road in 1972 with The Monckton in the background, via The News, Portsmouth.\\nLike many make-do-and-mend pubs of the 1940s and early 1950s, The Monckton survived longer than might have been expected, still trading into the 1980s.\\nWhat isn't immediately obvious is why construction of this pub was authorised during a time of restrictions.\\n\"Bet this was controversial,\" we said to ourselves and it didn't take long to find evidence that, yes, it was, in the form of a letter to the Portsmouth Evening News published on 13 February 1942:\\nSir – On Sunday night I listened to Sir Stafford Cripps giving his very interesting and informative talk on Russia's mighty effort to win the war. During this talk every listener was more or less asked, by Sir Stafford, to search his or her conscience as to whether they were engaged on or doing 100 per cent, work and thought, to bring about the same conclusion… I always feel that it is not fair to judge a nation's effort by one own city or locality. There would, however, appear to something wrong in Portsmouth when I notice this afternoon a new public-house being built on Copnor Road. Surely the men engaged in this contract, and the materials being used, could be put to our war effort, at this critical time? I know the answer will be \"a licence was granted,\" but what right had that particular public servant to grant such a licence? He was given his present position to control the building industry and direct its use to the war effort, not to evade the Government Order (Restricting New Buildings) by issuing permits. It appears to that we want quite a number of men in key positions who can say and definitely mean it.\\nOur guess, pending further research, is that it was a question of morale.\\nPortsmouth lost 73 pubs to enemy action during 1940-41 and Eley and Riley reckon more than a hundred had been destroyed by February 1942.\\nPerhaps sparing a few bricks for the construction of a basic two-room pub felt worth it.\\nTags hampshire, portsmouth, war, world war ii</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>\n","    <div class=\"colab-df-buttons\">\n","\n","  <div class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <button class=\"colab-df-convert\" onclick=\"convertToInteractive('df-ea94e24d-3833-4c29-9d1e-bd82ad7d46c0')\"\n","            title=\"Convert this dataframe to an interactive table.\"\n","            style=\"display:none;\">\n","\n","  <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\" viewBox=\"0 -960 960 960\">\n","    <path d=\"M120-120v-720h720v720H120Zm60-500h600v-160H180v160Zm220 220h160v-160H400v160Zm0 220h160v-160H400v160ZM180-400h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160ZM180-180h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160Z\"/>\n","  </svg>\n","    </button>\n","\n","  <style>\n","    .colab-df-container {\n","      display:flex;\n","      gap: 12px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #E8F0FE;\n","      border: none;\n","      border-radius: 50%;\n","      cursor: pointer;\n","      display: none;\n","      fill: #1967D2;\n","      height: 32px;\n","      padding: 0 0 0 0;\n","      width: 32px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #E2EBFA;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n","      fill: #174EA6;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-buttons div {\n","      margin-bottom: 4px;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #3B4455;\n","      fill: #D2E3FC;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #434B5C;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n","      filter: drop-shadow(0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3));\n","      fill: #FFFFFF;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","\n","    <script>\n","      const buttonEl =\n","        document.querySelector('#df-ea94e24d-3833-4c29-9d1e-bd82ad7d46c0 button.colab-df-convert');\n","      buttonEl.style.display =\n","        google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?

For Immediate Release--THE HUNT FOR TOMORROW is an on-line scavenger hunt that will send participants on a virtual odyssey through twenty-two dystopian futures in search of the answers they need to win. The Hunt is on for one weekend only, although there is no time-limit for completing the course.\\nIntrepid scavengers must solve clues at each of the dystopian author stops as they progress through the course. The twenty-two participating indie authors all have books included in three dystopian boxed sets - What Tomorrow May Bring, A Taste of Tomorrow, and Shattered Worlds.\\n\\\"Indie publishing is often a solitary experience. All of these authors coming together to work toward a common goal is an extraordinary thing,\\\" said author Tony Bertauski, curator of What Tomorrow May Bring. \\\"The enthusiasm for an engaging, communal effort like this scavenger hunt shows the willingness of indie authors to share their fans, and that can only be a good thing for readers.\\\"\\nWINNER TO NAME CHARACTERS AND TITLE FOR INTRIGUING PROGRESSIVE STORY\\nIn a rare instance of collaborative story-telling, nineteen of the authors will write a progressive short story over nineteen days. Each author will have one day to write between 500-1000 words before passing the story on to the next author to create a collective vision of a new, dark future. The winner of The Hunt will name characters and contribute elements to create this dystopian world, and all participants in The Hunt will receive an advance copy of the story for an exclusive period before it is made available as a free download.\\nThose who complete the scavenger hunt will be entered into a random draw, and for each correct answer collected along the way they will receive an additional chance to win. Along with the naming opportunity, the Grand Prize also includes a signed copy of each author's book that is included in the boxed sets, an ebook of all the boxed sets, and the first copy of the progressive story they themselves inspired. During The Hunt, the authors will offer up their own exclusive material, sneak peeks, contests, and giveaways at their individual stops on The Hunt, giving all scavengers multiple chances to win bonus prizes.\\nThe indie authors participating in The Hunt include best-selling, award-winning and emerging writers from the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. While their dystopian tales might be bleak, cynical, or despairing visions of the future, they ultimately carry messages of hope.\\nTHE HUNT FOR TOMORROW is the outcome of three separate group endeavors by these independent authors. By jointly marketing their books in curated boxed sets, they are able to successfully cross-promote their work and spike sales in a challenging and competitive marketplace. With the boxed sets, the scavenger hunt, and the progressively written short story, these dystopian authors are staking out their own collaborative utopia in the brave new world of indie publishing.\\nTHE HUNT FOR TOMORROW begins at http://huntfortomorrow.blogspot.com on Friday, July 18 at 6:00pm (EST) and ends on Sunday, July 20 at 6:00pm (EST). The Hunt is open to scavengers around the world; there is no cost to enter and one grand prize winner will be selected at random from all eligible entries.\\nThe DYSTOPTIMISTS\\nShining Light on a Dark Future\\nWHAT TOMORROW MAY BRING boxed set\\nSusan Kaye Quinn *\\nDavid J Normoyle\\nJoeseph Turkot\\nA TASTE OF TOMORROW boxed set\\nJason Gurley*\\nChris Ward\\nSaul Tanpepper\\nDeirdre Gould\\nSHATTERED WORLDS boxed set\\nElle Casey**\\nKatie French\\nZoe Cannon*\\nScott Cramer\\nShalini Boland\\nSarah Dalton\\n*Hunt only, not contributing to progressive short story\\n**Short story only, not participating in Hunt.\\nhttp://huntfortomorrow.blogspot.com\\nPlease include this information in any upcoming announcements and event listings.\\nFor further information, interview requests, ebooks for review, and book cover or author images please contact:\\nrixwrites@bell.net\\nBe Ready for The Hunt\\nPosted by Tony Bertauski at 12:35 PM\",\n          \"Tag: portsmouth\\n20th Century Pub pubs\\nThe Monckton, Portsmouth: a pub built under fire\\nPost date 6th December 2020\\n4 Comments on The Monckton, Portsmouth: a pub built under fire\\nSomething unusual happened in 1942: a new pub came into being.

Fine currently directs the San Diego Teacher Residency, hosted at the High Tech High Graduate School of Education, and also teaches courses in educational leadership at the University of California San Diego and at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. Her recent book, coauthored with Jal Mehta, is In Search of Deeper learning: The Quest to Transform the American High School.\\nLead The Change: The 2022 AERA theme is Cultivating Equitable Education Systems for the 21st Century and charges researchers and practitioners with dismantling oppressive education systems and replacing them with antiracist, equity, and justice-oriented systems. To achieve these goals, researchers must engage in new methodologies, cross-disciplinary thinking, global perspectives, and community partnerships to respond to the challenges of the 21st century including the COVID-19 Pandemic and systemic racism among other persistent inequities. Given the dire need for all of us to do more to dismantle oppressive systems and reimagine new ways of thinking and doing in our own institutions and education more broadly, what specific responsibility do educational change scholars have in this space? What steps are you taking to heed this call?\\nSarah Fine: Paulo Freire offered us the notion of praxis: cycles of inquiry which involve thinking critically about how sociopolitical systems work, taking action to create positive change, and reflecting on the process (Freire, 1970). A number of brilliant folks have written about how educators can take up Freire's ideas in K-12 classrooms (Duncan-Andrade & Morrell, 2008; hooks, 1994). To this work I would add my own conviction that scholars of educational change, too, need to engage in praxis \\u2014 and I believe that this praxis must involve more than simply galvanizing our students to do good work once they are \\\"in the field.\\\" This enlarged vision is no small commitment. The academy tends to reward thought over action, description over transformation, and theorizing about rather than theorizing with those who lead and work in schools. Plus, postulating on paper or in a lecture hall is comfortable; the world of K-12 public schools \\u2014 \\\"the field\\\" \\u2014 is a muddy, messy, imperfect place where elegant theories are inevitably complicated by the human-ness of human systems. Talking about implications for action is vanishingly simple by comparison to the actual work of making change in schools. I would argue, however, that it is imperative for us to do both: to read and write and observe and theorize, and also to enter into long-term action-focused partnerships which become a \\\"text\\\" that informs our scholarship. One without the other is insufficient.\\nThis desire to engage in praxis has been a guide for my own career choice. After nearly a decade spent exploring the notion of deeper learning through qualitative research, I chose to depart academia in order to road-test my ideas by designing and directing a teacher residency program run out of an alternative institution of higher education. I admit that this project sometimes runs the risk of straying from Freire's vision; my days \\\"in the field\\\" are sometimes so breathless that they leave little room for reflection. But that, too, tells a story about what it will take to accelerate efforts at transformation. We must reimagine what it means to be in practice as an educator, providing support and incentives for those who spend their time in and around K-12 schools to contribute their wisdom and experiences to the field's knowledge-base. It is these kinds of shifts that can help us all to move beyond patterns of siloing and exploitation and to make good on a collaborative commitment to positive change.\\nLtC: Through your work as the Director of the San Diego Teacher Residency at High Tech High Graduate School of Education, you support future teachers in creating justice-oriented classrooms rooted in deeper learning and strengthen the pipeline for teachers of color. What are some of the major lessons the field of Educational Change can learn from your work and experience?\\nSF: In our recent book, Jal Mehta and I explored the idea of symmetry, e.g. the presence of guiding principles and practices which anchor the experiences of both adults and children in schools (Mehta & Fine, 2019). We argued that schools can make headway toward ambitious goals by cultivating symmetry \\u2014 for example, by seeking to embed opportunities for extended inquiry or apprenticeship into adult learning as well as into classrooms. Based on my experiences designing and running the San Diego Teacher Residency, it turns out that symmetry is equally important in the context of teacher preparation. This is to say that novice teachers need the same things younger learners do in order to thrive and learn deeply: psychological safety, authentic purposes, culturally affirming pedagogy, tasks which lie within their zone of proximal development, modeling and support from expert mentors, opportunities to engage in productive struggle, and pauses to reflect on and celebrate their growth. On top of this, learning to teach for justice requires unlearning many of the normative beliefs and practices that dominate the field. This is true for white teachers and also for teachers of color, who may more easily recognize the myriad forms of oppression and marginalization that dominate traditional classrooms but still need to experience and learn new repertoires of practice by which to resist the pull of doing things as they have always been done. For example, we have found that with carefully designed coursework and expert facilitation, our teacher residents (white and BIPOC alike) are fairly quick to grasp why punitive and exclusionary classroom disciplinary policies are so inequitable. However, understanding what not to do does not automatically come along with the knowledge of what to do instead \\u2014 and without viable alternatives, even teachers who recognize harmful practice will revert to the status quo. Thus, helping novices learn to \\\"see\\\" the problems of shallow, teacher-centered, eurocentric, one-size-fits- all pedagogy is the tip of the iceberg; the most important work lies in exploring and rehearsing new forms of instructional design and facilitation. This is where deliberate symmetry comes in, because every moment that our residents spend in our care is a moment to \\\"walk our talk\\\" by providing them with learning experiences that assist in the process of disruption and replacement.\\n\\\"Learning to teach for justice requires unlearning many of the normative beliefs and practices that dominate the field.\\\"\\nLtC: In your recent book, In Search of Deeper Learning, you argue for American high schools to create opportunities for deeper learning, teachers, administrators, parents, and educational communities need to unlearn ideas about schooling and set up organizational structures that value authentic problem solving and depth over breadth (among many other things!). In the past two years, how has remote learning and other school disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic changed this important work?\\nSF: During the long months of zoom school last year, those of us who spend our time thinking about teaching and learning looked on with mixture of apprehension and curiosity. Might the pandemic, for all of its awful-ness, finally open the door for the kinds of educational transformations that children so desperately need? Could this be the thing that would finally loosen the chokehold of the \\\"grammar of schooling\\\" that has persisted for more than a century? I wish I could say that the answer was yes \\u2014 but in reality, the adjustments that I have seen schools and teachers make are subtle rather than dramatic. On the pessimistic side, at least from what I observed, much of what happened during remote schooling last year amounted to a doubling down on traditional practice. Elementary school teachers reverted to non-interactive read-alouds and assigned more than normal amounts of independent work; secondary teachers talked at their students even more than before; and everyone struggled to figure out how to get kids to interact meaningfully in breakout rooms. Things have gradually settled down with the return to in-person schooling this year, but I haven't seen many examples of experiments or transformations. On a more positive note, however, remote schooling seemed to galvanize many teachers and leaders to make serious commitments to relationship-building, social- emotional learning, and trauma-informed practices. These things have always been essential, but until the pandemic forced the issue, they often took a backseat to academic content. I have been heartened to see this shift in priorities persist during this year, but I fear that all the talk of \\\"learning loss\\\" \\u2014 not to mention the surge in staff shortages which are stretching all school staff extremely thin \\u2014 could quickly return us to where we started. Still, I see the whole situation as being in-process. Perhaps there will continue to be opportunities for educators, parents, and policymakers to realize that the status quo isn't something worth returning to after all. I'd like to believe that the pandemic has at very least increased everyone's appetite for radical change, which could open the door for visionary educators (and scholars?) to try to do things differently.\\n\\\"Productive change processes require disrupting traditional power dynamics.\\\"\\nLtC: Educational Change expects those engaged in and with schools, schooling, and school systems to spearhead deep and often difficult transformation. How might those in the field of Educational Change best support these individuals and groups through these processes?\\nSF: As a start, I would argue that those who are spearheading educational change should start by focusing on assets rather than deficits. Ask: Where are the bright spots? Who in our system is already galvanized around doing things differently? If students or educators are not succeeding in certain ways or in certain spaces, where and under what conditions are they thriving? How can we develop what already exists into visible proof-points that help everyone imagine why and how to do things differently? Don't get me wrong \\u2014 it's still crucial to explore and map out the root causes of dysfunction \\u2014 but asset-focused questions are far more energizing and efficacious than their inverse. On a separate note, I would argue that productive change processes require disrupting traditional power dynamics. Get folks from all parts of the system at the table together \\u2014 not just district and school leaders, for example, but teachers and special educators and paraprofessionals and even students \\u2014 and construct agreements and group culture that encourages them to listen deeply and speak from what they know. This decision honors the idea that the ones closest to the problem are closest to the solution, and it also positions the change process itself, not just the desired goals of the process, as an equity-focused intervention. Finally, I believe that it is critical that everyone involved in the change process needs to see themselves and be seen as a learner. School and district leaders often feel pressure to know \\\"the answers\\\" and to direct change from arm's length, but the most powerful processes require new ways of being and doing. In turn, this demands opportunities for everyone involved to engage in productive struggle, to try out new practices without the certainty that they will work, and to experience the kinds of learning and/or culture that is sought for the entire system.\\nLtC: Where do you perceive the field of Educational Change is going? What excites you about Educational Change now and in the future?\\nSF: I began my career as a teacher and (a bit later) my training as a scholar during the first decade of the 21st century: an era which was dominated by an obsession with top-down reforms and narrowly conceived indicators of educational quality. During those years, studying educational change in ways that the academy would validate involved doing research about or on schools and measuring impact using test-score-based metrics. The past decade, however, has seen the start of a long-overdue reckoning with the ways in which education research has too often been voyeuristic, exploitative, racially biased, and limited in its imagination of the possible. The growing visibility of paradigms such as Participatory Action Research and Design Based Implementation Research, along with the amplification of the voices of BIPOC scholars and practitioners and the expansion of Research-Practitioner Partnership opportunities, suggests that the world is gradually recognizing that educational change must involve working with and within communities of practice and defining educational \\\"goods\\\" more broadly. This excites me! As I wrote earlier, I believe that scholars of educational change have an obligation to engage in praxis, which requires forming long-term partnerships with practitioners and learning about the world by trying to change it. I'd like to believe that the structures of higher education eventually will shift to support this expansion of scholarly purposes and positioning. As it currently stands at many major schools of education, however, tenure-seeking scholars are still obligated to focus most of their efforts on producing first-authored publications in academic journals \\u2014 which are stylistically inaccessible to lay readers and also usually live behind paywalls. Teaching and service to the institution come next, with community engagement and public scholarship treated as side-notes. On the other side of the \\\"research/practice divide,\\\" the work of educators and school/district leaders is mainly action-focused; there is rarely time or material support for doing much more than keeping the train on the tracks. I hope that the field as a whole will continue to elevate research-practice partnerships which can create positive change for educators and children and produce usable knowledge in the process.\\nDuncan-Andrade, J.
